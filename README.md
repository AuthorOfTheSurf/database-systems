# Database Systems & DB Design Project
================

The work done in this repo was for CMSI 486, the senior-level LMU Database Systems course. Included are some sql-related assignments as well as `db-design-project`, a semester-long project involving the design and implementation of a database for a particular business or situation. My project was about modeling an Online Music Business for a fictitious rapper named John.
